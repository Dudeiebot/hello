Hey bullish here, setting the input in and giving you reason to be bullish as fvck
you know for a reason these is a test and dont forget that everything has a reason for there input.



word = input("Enter a message: ")

# Define an array of characters representing the ASCII table
ascii_table = [chr(i) for i in range(128)]
ascii_num = ascii_table.index(word)

binary = [0] * 32  # array to store binary digits
i = 0
while ascii_num > 0:
    binary[i] = ascii_num % 2
    ascii_num = ascii_num // 2
    i += 1

j = i - 1
if j >= 0 and binary[j] == 0:
    # Dark emoji
    print("\U000026AB")
else:
    # Light emoji
    print("\U0001F7E1")
